MEPS-HC: Prescribed medicine utilization and expenditures for the treatment of hyperlipidemia


This example code shows how to link the MEPS-HC Medical Conditions file to the 
Prescribed Medicines file for data year 2021 in order to estimate the following:

National totals:
   - Total number of people w/ at least one PMED fill for hyperlipidemia (HL)
   - Total number of PMED fills for HL
   - Total PMED expenditures for HL 

Percent of people with PMED fill
   - Among people ever diagnosed with HL (CHOLDX = 1)
		> By race/ethnicity

Per-person averages:
   - Avg number of PMED fills for HL
        > Among people ever diagnosed with HL (CHOLDX = 1)
		> Among people with any PMED fill for HL

   - Avg PMED expenditures for HL
        > Among people ever diagnosed with HL (CHOLDX = 1)
		> Among people with any PMED fill for HL

Regression:
   - Percent of people with PMED fill by RACE
   - P(Any PMED for HL) = RACE + SEX + INSURANCE + POVERTY
