MEPS-HC: Prescribed medicine utilization and expenditures for the treatment of hyperlipidemia


This example code shows how to link the MEPS-HC Medical Conditions file to the 
Prescribed Medicines file for data year 2021 in order to estimate the following:

National totals:
   - Total number of people w/ at least one PMED fill for hyperlipidemia (HL)
   - Total number of PMED fills for HL
   - Total PMED expenditures for HL 

Percent of people with PMED fill
   - Among people ever diagnosed with HL (CHOLDX = 1)
		> By race/ethnicity

Per-person averages:
   - Avg number of PMED fills for HL
        > Among people ever diagnosed with HL (CHOLDX = 1)
		> Among people with any PMED fill for HL

   - Avg PMED expenditures for HL
        > Among people ever diagnosed with HL (CHOLDX = 1)
		> Among people with any PMED fill for HL

Regression:
   - Percent of people with PMED fill by RACE
   - P(Any PMED for HL) = RACE + SEX + INSURANCE + POVERTY

Input files:
  - h229a.sas7bdat        (2021 Prescribed Medicines file)
  - h231.sas7bdat         (2021 Conditions file)

 LOAD DATA   
 
 1 - Download SAS files from meps.ahrq.gov
 2 - Set libname for where MEPS SAS data files are saved on your computer  
 3 - Read in PUFs and keep only needed variables
